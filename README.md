# SATALLITE-ORBIT-SIMULATION-
This repository contains my first MATLAB simulation of a satellite orbiting Earth at 200 km altitude. The project focuses on visualizing circular orbital motion and understanding basic spatial transformations. It is an initial step in exploring space dynamics and computational modeling.
